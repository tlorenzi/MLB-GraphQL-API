# MLB-GraphQL-API
This is a GraphQL API that allows users to fetch data about a team's past seasons.
You can run queries in the browser and see the docs with GraphiQL. There is tokenless single endpoint 
available to the public.

I removed my connection string for the MongoDB database, so the app cannot be ran locally.
